# Fake News Detection using Hybrid CNN and RNN

### Why CNN and RNN?
In model training, model is based on the dataset we have used and also how we maniplutae or extract feature from the given data. So for this projet we have used CNN as a feature extractor and RNN for taring model 
- CNN:
  - Extracts local features effectively.
  - Captures spatial dependencies.
- RNN:
  - Used in sequential data.
  - LSTM - Extends the memory of RNN. Learns long-term dependencies.

### Dataset:
ISOT: https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php<br>
FA-KES: https://www.kaggle.com/mohamadalhasan/a-fake-news-dataset-around-the-syrian-war

### Noteook contain:
We have implemented 2 Notebook for ISOT and LSTM dataset. Both have similar model to train but there are some difference in some preprocessing part. Both Notebook  are self explanatory, what we have done.
